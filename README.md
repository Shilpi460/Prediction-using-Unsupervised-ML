# TASK 2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
This is my second task during my intership in Data Science & Business Analytics at The Sparks Foundation where the problem statement is to predict the optimum number of clusters from given dataset and represent it visually.<br>
In this task, I have used R with stats library for machine learning to implement the kmeans function. <br>
Here, I have determined the optimum number of clusters using the Elbow method.<br>
